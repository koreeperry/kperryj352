                            As frustrations among corrections officers mount, abusive treatment of inmates is rising and
                            becoming more vicious, records and interviews show.

                    <p>
                        Even in a system known for its brutality, what New York State prison guards did to Robert L.
                        Brooks and Messiah Nantwi stood out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Both men were handcuffed before guards beat them viciously, leaving them unable to defend
                        themselves or even shield their faces as the blows rained down. Both died soon after being
                        attacked, victims not of justified force but, essentially, of torture.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The killings caused a brief reckoning this year within the walled-off world of New York’s
                        prisons, resulting in criminal charges against 20 of the officers involved and sending officials
                        scrambling to try to portray the episodes as unacceptable aberrations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But a New York Times investigation has found that state prison guards have been credibly accused
                        of engaging in such behavior — putting inmates in restraints and then assaulting them — far more
                        often than was previously known.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Drawing on thousands of pages of court records, disciplinary data and interviews with dozens of
                        current and former inmates, The Times identified more than 120 instances in the past decade in
                        which guards were described as having punched, kicked or stomped on prisoners, smashed their
                        fingers in cell doors, held their legs apart and struck their genitals with batons, and even
                        waterboarded them — all while the prisoners were handcuffed or otherwise restrained.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Across the prison system, the rate at which staff members have used force against inmates has
                        been climbing steadily for the past decade.

                        New York State State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) Data on
                        Misconduct. Data includes Dispoition Date, Misconduct, and Penalty
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But interviews with watchdog officials, prisoners’ advocates and prisoners themselves suggest
                        that instances of the most egregious abuse have increased significantly in just the past three
                        years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The officials, advocates and prisoners have linked the increase partly to seething anger among
                        guards over recently enacted limits on their ability to use solitary confinement. And they said
                        the uptick had been accompanied by a general increase in rule breaking by officers, who maintain
                        that the solitary confinement restrictions have made their jobs less safe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Just before 10 guards were charged in the killing of Mr. Brooks in February, thousands of
                        officers walked off the job in illegal strikes across the state, plunging the prisons into chaos
                        and prompting Gov. Kathy Hochul to deploy the National Guard to restore order. When officers
                        began returning to work weeks later, many were still fuming, inmates said.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “The abuse has been worse since the strike,” said Duane Brown, 44, who is serving 30 years to
                        life for murder and said guards at Green Haven Correctional Facility had beaten him to
                        unconsciousness in September.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A spokesman for the union that represents the guards, the New York State Correctional Officers
                        and Police Benevolent Association, denied that officers had tortured inmates. He acknowledged
                        that they were using force more often but said they were doing so because of working conditions
                        that left them no choice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “The reality is that when you are dealing with inmates who attack staff and other inmates and
                        refuse orders to cease, force is necessary to contain the situation and minimize the amount of
                        injuries that occur at the hands of inmates,” the spokesman, James Miller, said.
                    </p>

                    <p>But a vast majority of cases identified by The Times did not fit that description.</p>

                    <p>
                        One occurred in June 2024 at Clinton Correctional Facility near the Canadian border, where
                        guards handcuffed Ernastiaze Moore, a 25-year-old inmate who had filed lawsuits against prison
                        staff members, punched and kicked him and then dragged him to a medical room, where they held a
                        plastic bag over his head until he lost consciousness.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another beating unfolded in September 2023 at Sing Sing Correctional Facility north of New York
                        City, where Dane Stuart, 34, said guards restrained his hands before putting him in a chokehold
                        and stomping on his arms and legs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A third happened in April 2022 at Collins Correctional Facility near Buffalo, where Byron
                        Santos, 28, said guards handcuffed him, put him in a headlock, threw him to the floor, kicked
                        him and knelt on the back of his neck.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a prison system where more than 75 percent of employees are white and 73 percent of prisoners
                        are Black or Hispanic, many of the incidents had racist overtones, inmates said, with white
                        guards using racial epithets and other demeaning language during attacks. One inmate said guards
                        restrained him and then called him a slur as they punched and kicked him and tore dreadlocks
                        from his scalp at Clinton in 2021.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most guards who are accused of such abuse are never charged with crimes, or even disciplined.
                        There were about 9,500 misconduct investigations brought against officers from 2000 to
                        mid-October 2020 and closed by mid-2021, an average of more than 460 a year or about 38 a month,
                        records show. Of those, about 10 percent involved accusations of inmate abuse. A vast majority
                        of guards accused in such cases were never terminated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said
                        that the safety of prison staff members and inmates was the agency’s “top priority.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “The department has zero tolerance for violence within our facilities,” the spokesman, Thomas
                        Mailey, said. “Anyone engaged in misconduct will be disciplined, and, if warranted, incidents
                        will be referred for outside prosecution.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At a public hearing in Albany in May, Daniel F. Martuscello III, the state’s corrections
                        commissioner, acknowledged problems and promised improvements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Individuals are sent to prison as punishment, not for punishment, and there is an expectation
                        of safety and opportunities for rehabilitation,” he said. “The last few months have challenged
                        the foundation of this belief.”
                    </p>

                    <p>Any reform efforts face a steep uphill climb, current and former inmates said.</p>

                    <p>
                        At the Marcy Correctional Facility, where Mr. Brooks was killed, vicious beatings occurred so
                        often that Sean Chung, a 29-year-old former inmate who worked there as a janitor, said in an
                        interview that he had developed a routine to clean up after them.
                    </p>

                    <p>He would follow orders to face the wall and listen as the first blows landed.</p>

                    <p>
                        “I am hearing loud thuds,” said Mr. Chung, who was released on parole in 2024 after serving
                        eight years for weapons possession and conspiracy. Then came shouts from the guards: “‘Stop
                        resisting, stop fighting, put your hands behind your back!’”
                    </p>

                    <div class="pull-quote">
                        <p>
                        “You hear the hard, gut-wrenching punches,” he said, “the screams, the ‘I’m sorrys,’ ‘I can’t
                        breathes,’ ‘You’re going to kill me.’ You hear ‘Mom,’ and it gets quiet and you just keep
                        hearing the thuds.”

                    <p>
                        Afterward, he said, his eyes would water and his throat would burn as he scrubbed the oily
                        residue of pepper spray from the walls. He would use a mop to soak up blood from cracks in the
                        floor and apply disinfectants to areas where urine and feces were sometimes left behind. He had
                        a red bin marked “hazardous waste” for collecting broken teeth, torn-out hair and bits of
                        clothing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “It used to be traumatizing, but then it became normal. This is every day,” Mr. Chung said,
                        before adding, “Everybody knows about this.”
